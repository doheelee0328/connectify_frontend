# connectify_front_end
This is a all-in-one application for companies and businesses of all sizes that contains many tool and functionalities used within a company. The app is built using React and allows both an employee and an employer to sign up and login to their respective accounts.

## Why we developed this app?

In today's modern workplace, businesses often face the challenge of using multiple tools for different organizational tasks. Communication might happen through messaging apps like WhatsApp or Slack, while finance and payslip management rely on software like Sage HR. Meanwhile, traditional methods such as pen and paper or email are still used for booking time off or reporting emergencies/sick days. This fragmented approach can be overwhelming and inefficient, leading to confusion and wasted time.

To address these issues and streamline organizational processes, we developed this app. 

## Features
- Rota Management: Employees can view the complany schedule when planning events
- Booking events: Users can book make a booking request
- Chat: Employees and Employers can communicate with each other
- Well-being section: Employees can re-charge through talking with a online therapist, add journal entries of their days and read blog posts about improving work well-being.

## Planning

## Miro 

We leveraged Miro, a collaborative online whiteboarding platform, for brainstorming sessions. Miro allowed our team to ideate, capture ideas, and visually organize thoughts in a digital workspace. Through this collaborative environment, we fostered creativity, encouraged cross-team collaboration, and collected valuable insights to shape the app's features and functionality.

## ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)

To design the database architecture and establish the relationships between different entities within the app, we employed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). The ERD provided a visual representation of the database structure, illustrating how entities and attributes are connected. This helped us ensure data integrity and maintain a coherent database design throughout the development process.

## Kanban board

To track and manage the project's tasks, we utilized a Kanban board. This agile project management tool allowed us to create and organize tasks into different stages, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed." By visualizing the workflow, our team could easily prioritize tasks, monitor progress, and ensure a smooth and transparent development process.

## Figma

For designing and prototyping the user interface (UI) of the app, we relied on Figma. With Figma, we were able to create interactive prototypes, define the app's visual style, and iterate on the design based on user feedback. This allowed us to ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for our app.
