    title: 'Promoting Health: Fitness & Nutrition',
    date: '12th June 2020',
    image: Welbeing2,
    details: `
    Most of us know about the harm poor eating habits and physical inactivity can do. Unhealthy food choices and sitting down at a desk for the majority of the day can leave people feeling unmotivated or unwell. A healthy workforce is more productive, with fewer absences, increased productivity and higher morale.
    
    Here are some tips to help you promote fitness and healthy eating choices in your workplace.`,
    heading1: `Create a walking club or fitness challenges`,
    details1: `Suggest activities for people to get involved in before work, at lunch, or after the workday. There is no simpler way to exercise over an hour-long lunch break than walking. Lead a new initiative by committing to going yourself. You’ll show employees you can “walk the walk,” and might even glean some valuable insights about work along the way. You can also use the LifeWorks app to establish group fitness challenges that can be a fun way to motivate people to add more exercise to their day. They’re also a great way to keep remote workers engaged and active as part of the team.`,

    heading2: 'Bring in the professionals',
    details2: ` Offer classes that help relieve stress or have a registered dietician come in to talk about making healthy food choices. Yoga in the workplace, for example, is becoming more and more common.`,
    heading3: 'Ditch unhealthy food',
    details3: `Don’t let accessibility to junk food be the reason your staff are choosing a candy bar over a healthier option. Ask your vending machine provider to incorporate healthier options, and instead of bringing a box of donuts to the next staff meeting, put out a bowl of fresh, washed fruit. These small changes send a subtle yet important message and can go a long way in encouraging your staff.`,

    title: 'Self-Care is not Selfish',
    date: '20th July 2021',
    image: Welbeing3,
    details: `Self-care is essential for good health and wellbeing. Far from being selfish, self-care can help you to be a healthier, happier person, at home and at work.
    To promote better wellbeing among employees, organizations and their leaders have a responsibility to foster a culture of self-care in the workplace and help more individuals access the resources they need to make self-care a habit.`,
    heading1: 'The many benefits of self-care',
    details1: `
    Self-care encompasses a wide range of activities and lifestyle changes. It can be as simple as spending 5 minutes a day journaling or going for a walk in a green space. Alternatively, it can also be as extensive as adopting a completely new set of behaviors to help manage a chronic condition.
    The beneficial effects of self-care have been demonstrated by extensive research, which has found self-care to improve well-being while lowering morbidity and mortality. As mental stress continues to rise across the western world, self-care is becoming even more imperative as a method for improving mental health and wellness.
    Self-care is especially important for individuals with chronic conditions. It is a key method for improving health outcomes, especially through long-term behavioral changes such as diet management and stress relief. For organizations, effective employee self-care can dramatically reduce healthcare costs and limit absenteeism.`,
    heading2: 'Encouraging a culture of self-care',
    details2: `Organizations can dramatically improve employee wellbeing by building self-care initiatives into their company culture. From integrated wellbeing solutions like LifeWorks to dedicated wellness days for teams, self-care schemes can make an enormous difference to workplace wellbeing. How will you make self-care a priority in your workforce?`,
    heading3: 'Making self-care a habit',
    details3: `It can be hard to break old habits and create new, healthier ones in their place, especially without guidance. This is where employers can have a hugely positive impact on the adoption of self-care activities among their workforce.
    Person-centered interventions, especially those using digital technology, can dramatically improve self-care behavior change. Digital health technology like mobile health and wellbeing apps can provide much-needed guidance for individuals, while also promoting better support between peers and facilitating communication with healthcare professionals.
    By simplifying the patient journey, technology can help generate long-term behavior changes and encourage better patient engagement. Integrated health solutions empower individuals and in turn improve the adoption of self-care habits.
    You can encourage a culture of self-care in your workplace by implementing company-wide initiatives for improving access to self-care resources. Targeted strategies to encourage more self-care, and change the mindset that self-care is selfish, will allow you to build a healthier, stronger workforce.`,

    title: 'What is well-being, and what’s the ROI?',
    date: '24th July 2019',
    image: Welbeing1,
    details: `How do you measure the ROI of wellbeing? When it comes to implementing or continuing well-being programs, companies find themselves in this predicament. While companies can look to certain data points, a fair portion of the data is anecdotal. How do you prove that a well-being program has value? `,
    heading1: 'Why Well-Being?',
    details1: `In recent years, more companies have started including well-being programs as part of their benefits packages. This could include things such as employee assistance programs (EAPs), elder-care programs, financial-planning workshops or yoga and meditation classes. The list of well-being options seems to grow every day, which can create some headache for the ones deciding on the programs that would work best for their employees.
    Headache or not, companies are realizing they have no choice but to start looking into how to help employees “be well.”
    “Millennials have truly revolutionized work,” said Ali Payne, global well-being and engagement practice leader at Gallagher, a global insurance brokerage, risk management and consulting services business based in Rolling Meadows, Ill. “It’s not just about compensation and benefits anymore. They need all the gadgets.”
    As such, “benefits professionals in general are thinking much more comprehensively about what they are offering.”
    Aside from typical insurance benefits and other more “traditional” offerings, benefits professionals are considering programs that “you would have never talked about 10 to 15 years ago,” Payne said.
    “The upcoming generations entering the workforce are expecting this,” said Daniel Harding, CCP, GRP, SPHR, senior leader of total rewards and employee relations at MVP Health Care Inc. “To them, they think it shouldn’t be that hard (to implement a well-being program).”
    And to some extent, maybe the newer generations have a point. In this day and age of “I’ve got an app for that,” why should it be so difficult for an employer to, say, launch a sustainability program?
    The answer lies somewhere in the data.`,
    heading2: 'Defining Success',
    details2: `
    In order to get to the data, the human resources team needs to first define what success looks like.
    “A lot of employers are so focused on the problem and implementing a solution that it becomes sort of the tail wagging the dog when it comes to defining success,” said Kristin Parker, a partner, Total Health Management Specialty Practice leader at Mercer.
    From Payne’s point of view, there are “three buckets where employers are thinking about success.” They are employee engagement, rewards and recognition, and testimonies.
    Employee engagement is one of the easier data points to focus on. Through surveys or event head counts, it is simple to see if a program is being used. And that data does more than just indicate if a program is well received — it can also help program leaders see if they are offering the right programs to engage their employees.
    There are potential downsides, however, to solely focusing on employee engagement. For example, if a company offers a subsidy for a gym membership. “Sometimes employees don’t participate,” Payne said. “But they still like that they have the option.”
    In terms of rewards and recognition, this may take a little more legwork. Payne uses the example of “Best Places to Work” lists, which typically lay out all the perks a “best” company uses. This can help other companies answer the question, “Do we have the right resources in place to drive employees to come to work every day?” Payne said.
    Testimonies — that is, direct feedback from employees or anecdotal feedback from managers — are where the data starts to get more subjective. But that information is no less valuable, Payne asserts.
    “There are certain things that employees stay for and things they don’t stay for,” she said.
    Getting that feedback could be tricky. But Payne suggests using survey comments or even exit interviews as a means to retrieve that information.
    MVP began rolling out various well-being programs four or five years ago. The health-care company wanted to “walk the walk,” Harding said. At that point, MVP opted to use a scorecard that would help measure a program’s success. That scorecard also offered information to help the company tweak programs, as well as decide what programs to keep, add or eliminate.
    Furthermore, it gave the company a snapshot into what was next, giving guidance on the question “What’s the next stressor?”
    Mercer’s Parker urges companies to “make sure success is defined early on.” She suggests focusing on the “Triple Aim” approach: improving the patient (in this case, the employee) experience, improving outcomes and reducing costs — both for the company and the employee.
    Once success has been defined, then is the time to figure out the methodology on how to obtain that information`,
    heading3: 'Getting Buy-In: Data is Currency',
    details3: `In addition to measuring the success of a well-being program, data can also come in handy in one very important way: getting buy-in from leadership.
    Traditionally, leadership has focused on health-care metrics, such as health-risk assessments, behavioral-health claims and pharmacy claims, Parker noted. But as more types of well-being programs pop up and the usual data is less concrete, there are other things to consider.
    Take, for instance, a meditation program. Given that distraction is the leading cause of injuries at work, teaching an employee mindfulness “could significantly decrease the number of injuries on the job,” she said. That could, in turn, increase productivity and could “ultimately be a bottom-line revenue generator, or increase the creativity and innovation that can lead to revenue generation.”
    Understanding what services vendors might provide — and if those services are already included in your contract — is crucial to getting leadership on board, Payne said.
    “The worst thing you could do is go to your executives and say, ‘I want to spend more money,’ but you haven’t done your homework.”
    For example, perhaps your insurance provider offers other resources, such as financial planning. Finding out that you are already paying for that benefit but didn’t realize it is a good way to get the OK.
    “You do want to make sure you are using all the services your vendor has,” Harding said.
    Harding stresses that it’s also important to make leadership understand that it’s not just about return on investment that counts when it comes to well-being: It’s also value on investment.
    “You hope that your retention rate goes up, turnover goes down and attraction goes up,” he said. “But ultimately, there is a return,” financially and otherwise.
    In some cases, “it’s tough to sell,” he said. Still, “if I can save 1%, even 0.5%, on my medical spend year after year (through the reduction of various health claims), that’s quite a change.”
    “The money is going to get spent somewhere,” he said. So why not on well-being?`,

    details: `Work-life balance is the strongest workplace driver of personal happiness, according to the 2017 World Happiness Report. The report found that a healthy balance between work and home could lead to greater job satisfaction and overall well-being. Here are a couple of ideas on how you can adjust your day-to-day activities to feel more engaged, more productive, and happier at work and home:`,
    heading1: 'Focus on your priorities',
    details1:
      'Take stock of what’s most important to you. One way to do that is by asking yourself: If I passed away suddenly, how would I want to be remembered? Then prioritize activities that support these core personal values—and consider cutting back on other activities when you can.',
    heading2: 'Share the load at home.',
    details2:
      'If you live with a partner, sit down together periodically to decide how to divvy up the household chores, shopping, errands, and childcare responsibilities. To gain a better understanding of what the other person does, try switching roles for a couple of days.',
    heading3: 'Carve out time for fun',
    details3:
      'When there’s a lot to do, putting playtime on your calendar may seem frivolous. But doing something healthy and relaxing gives you a chance to recover from today’s demands—and that helps you be ready for tomorrow.',

    title: 'Self Care: Things to consider',
    date: '24th July 2020',
    image: Welbeing4,
    details: `July 24 is International Self-Care Day. It’s become a hot topic in recent years as people realize the importance of mental, physical, and social wellbeing has on holistic health. Self-care can mean different things for different people: for some, it’s quiet time, meditation, and reflection; for others, it’s making time for treating yourself to spa days or ensuring there’s time to hit the gym. No matter what form it takes, self-care is a great way to minimize stress and optimize mental and physical health so that you can function at your best. Self-care is also not a one-and-done; it’s something you should do daily for maximum benefit as part of your overall personal health and wellness routine.
      As you figure out the self-care plan that works for you, here are a couple of key components to keep in mind that will help your version of self-care take shape.`,
    heading1: 'Making time: unplug and take breaks',
    details1: `
      Develop a healthier relationship with technology and take a break to unplug from your devices. Carve out time blocks in your day that are just for you; prioritize them and stick to them. You’ll ensure that you always have the time to do the things that can help you relax and feel restored. This will reduce anxiety, stress, help recharge your mind, and improve your overall quality of life.`,
    heading2: 'Finding space',
    details2: `Choosing an activity and finding time is only part of being able to feel more refreshed, happier, and more equipped to deal with others. Another is making sure you’ve got a space that’s just for you, or where you feel you can retreat to. It can be anywhere you feel comfortable and at peace – especially for activities like yoga, meditation, or reflection. It may be at home, at a park, or at a location where you get a service (like a massage therapist), but should be available to only you when you need it.`,
    heading3: 'Exercise and physical activity',
    details3: `For some, exercise and physical activity is the key component of their self-care routine. If it’s not part of yours, you may want to consider it. Exercise boosts overall wellbeing and decreases the chance of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
      The gym is only one possible place to get exercise for self-care. Some prefer at-home workouts. Exercise can be wide-ranging: aerobics, weightlifting, fitness classes, swimming, yoga, and more. Physical activity can have immediate and long-term physical health benefits and can help boost your mood too.
      Self-care builds up resilience and resolve so you can better take on challenges at work and at home, while still presenting the best version of yourself. It can help improve our immunity, increase positive thinking, and make us less vulnerable to stress, anxiety, and other wellbeing issues. There’s no right answer – it’s got to work for you. Use these tips to get the ball rolling, and if you need help along the way, your EAP can help!`,
